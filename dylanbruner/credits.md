Credits and stuff

Things that I implemented/thought of completly on my own are listed below
  - The virtual leaderboard system
  - The virtual gun system
  - Radar code, except for how it actually locks the rotation
  - Linear Gun
  - Painting
  - Pattern gun (gets used the most, the guess factor gun doesn't use enough parameters)
  - Anti gravity movement
  - Themer
  - How it picks targets


Note: LOTS of the math was borrowed from the internet because math is hard and we haven't 
      been taught the stuff I actually want to use. That being said I still have a rough
      idea of how it works and I know why it's used.

      So I will be able to explain everything in this robot save for possibly exactly what some
      math does. Although having said that, given 30 minutes with Google I could tell you what it does.

Things that I used external insperation for are listed below, along with any
changes I implemented.
